1. Insert Gemini API key in BuildConfig2 class
2. 3d models were too large to insert in the github for good practice. Email anujjainlasd@gmail.com to get access to 3d models.
3. For testing, try different modes and different situations. 3d models are made for the most common sudden emergency situations (heart attack, cardiac arrest, stroke, etc.)
4. For best experience, use a phone holder or tripod to use both hands while still being able to see the AR elements. Can be used without this as well.
